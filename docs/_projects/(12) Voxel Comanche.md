# Brief

An university project developed by Ivan Ivanov Mandev and Alvaro Soriano Romero on the Low level Programming subject in our university, it is pure C code with the SDL Graphic Library.

Our task was to mimic the "Voxel Comanche" Graphic Effect and to optimize the code as much as we could to later translate it to ARM code.
