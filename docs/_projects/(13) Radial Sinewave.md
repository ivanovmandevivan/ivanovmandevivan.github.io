# Brief

A student project developed by Ivan Ivanov Mandev and Alvaro Soriano Romero on the subject "Low Level Programming", we are using the SDL Graphic library and pure C code to be able to render this effect, meanwhile we also have it fully optimized and executing on a Raspberry Pi with ARM assembly code.
