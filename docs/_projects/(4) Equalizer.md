# Brief

A small OpenGL demo where we had to make the shaders react to the background music and we had to make it as interactive as possible through user input. It was entirely developed in C++.

It was done in a private engine called "**EDK**" developed by one of the teachers of the university in **ESAT**.

Developed by Ivan Ivanov Mandev and Jose Manuel Padilla Varea.
