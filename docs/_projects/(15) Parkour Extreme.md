# Brief

This demo with two levels was developed in a team dynamic for the "Game Design" subject in our university where the most important aspects were the mechanics and the level design.

This required a constant iteration and perfection over the mechanics and level design and a constant feedback from extern testers / friends that have iteratively played the game.

This project was developed by:

- Alvaro Soriaon Romero.
- Ivan Ivanov Mandev.
- Ivy Lilliana Ruffin (3D Artist - Hardsurface):
