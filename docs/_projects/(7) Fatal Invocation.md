# Brief

A game created by three students, Ivan Ivanov Mandev, Andres Gay Pau and Javier Miguel Valenciano in the Unity Engine, it is a turn based game where you have different levels that you need to surpass with hidden assassin goblins that you need to search for, the idea behind this game is that you have a tank, dps and a healer that you will be using to defeat those goblins, each enemy and ally has different statistics and some of the units have special attacks, such as the healer or the dps giving a damage boost to the party.
