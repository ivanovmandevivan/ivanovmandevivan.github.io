# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am a junior programmer that is introducing himself in the videogames industry, I am from Bulgaria, Sofia and lived most of my life in Spain, since I was a kind I liked videogames a lot given all the influence that Nintendo or Sony with PlayStation has given me, it really sparked a joy in me for the **how** they created such entertaining games.

This brought my curiosity for videogames to the next level, putting myself in the path of seeing how videogames were created from the core, thanks to my education in **ESAT** in Spain, Valencia I had the opportunity to learn from the beginning all the process of **programming** a videogame and turning my profile into a generalist programmer, learning about graphics programming, optimization, Android/iOS development, UE4/Unity, AI Programming, etc.

This education I received in ESAT allowed me to widen my horizons and allow me to introduce myself in the videogames industry as soon as possible. With the skills I have learnt my goal is in the long run develop a wholesome indie game with people that I meet along my journey in the videogames industry, just enjoying the teamwork and the communication and the whole process of creating a product that I can truly call "mine" alongside my partners in crime.

As far as hobbies and videogames I play, now that I shifted my focus to developing I tend to have less time to play videogames but my favourite genres are **Rogue-likes**, **Puzzle Games** and most of the **Nintendo Games** as you might have guessed.

As far as other hobbies, as any other normal human being :robot:, I like to watch series, read novels, do calisthenics and overall enjoy my time developing and evolving my own interpersonal skills such as doing pixelart, learning blender, adobe illustrator, adobe photoshop, etc.

I tend to always try to learn something new and do not lose the rhythm of trying to affront all the problems and difficulties in life with a positive but realistic point of view, never giving up and striving for my long term goals without ever giving up on them the slightest bit.
